# REQUIRES BOTH TRC 2.6+ AND FUSION 0.1.6+ TO WORK PROPERLY

The game of current versions is... Crossout - a post-apocalyptic MMO action game, the devs of which didn't pay me for promoting da thing:(

As of right now, it is in its earliest stages and only contains the following.


## Weapons

'Adapter', 'Charon', 'Thyrsus';

'Aurora', 'Trigger', 'Destructor';

'Prometheus', 'Helios';

MRLS 'Echelon' I and II (and these two are not the Ravagers' stuff :o)


## Shoutouts

sillysandvich for making 'Prometheus'' and 'Helios'' perks work🧡

the other the-shipyard people for being such cutie pies🧡



*"Version numbering shouldn't need a guide to read..."* they said.
But here goes my addon, dear people.


# Le Guide on How To Read These Versions

This is how the numbers work, so no one ever again gets confused by fish:

🦑 == Nik Nocturnal;

🐙 == The number of states in Australia;

🦞 == Dr. Nauter buys mangoes in several lots. In the first lot, he bought x mangoes for $3, in the second lot, he bought two more mangoes than in the first lot for $4, and in the third lot, he bought one less mango than in the second lot for $5. The total number of mangoes purchased is 14. What is the minimum number of mangoes he could have bought in any one lot? (the answer is calculated by the elimination method);

🐠 == The number of monitors that make life happy;

🐡 == The 579th decimal place of pi;

🦐 == The number of tails Tails would have to be a boring character;

🐬 == The odds of you meeting a dinosaur while walking down the street * 10;

🦈 == 8;

🐟 == How old were you when you were born;

🦀 == The number of letters in these Russian swear words that everyone keeps forgetting.


## Exercises:   1) v🐟.🦐.🐡 (which introduces this beautiful guide);
##              2) v🦐.🐙.🐠 (which will be about the other game).
			
Hopes this guide helped you❤.
