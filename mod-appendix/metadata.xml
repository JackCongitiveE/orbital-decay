PATCH AFTER MULTIVERSE, REQUIRES FUSION 0.1.6+ AND THE RENEGADE COLLECTION, PATCH BOTH OF THOSE BEFORE OD

This addon prooooobably will be based on a bunch of other games, which will be implemented as poorly as possible. Due to both lack of skill and total laziness ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
The game of the -🐟.versions iiis... Crossout - a post-apocalyptic MMO action game, the devs of which didn't pay me for promoting da thing:(

This is what the current version (-🐟.🦐.) can offer you, dear people:

	- Some Crossout weapons turned into the Ravagers' weapons (here they are, from left to right: 'Adapter', 'Charon', 'Thyrsus', 'Aurora', 'Trigger', 'Destructor', 'Prometheus', 'Helios'. They are buyable rn just due to the lack of other content😔);
	- Things I could't put into the upper section: 
			- 1(3) new Player Ship (Ravagers'; introduction purposes);
			- The Ballista Drones[DEF/BOARD, + Legion version], Zenith Lasers II and III, Legion Missiles, Legion Drones[Laser I, Laser II, Bomb]. Mostly unobtainable.

(Huge thanks to sillysnadvich for making 'Prometheus'' and 'Helios'' perks work, i luv u❤)
